This script will generate a position file, which can be used with the matcher algorithm in Rosetta. It was initially setup for helical bundles but will also do interactions between chain A and B. 

python generate_position_file.py -h
usage: generate_position_file.py [-h] [-d DISTANCE] [-b HELICAL_BUNDLE]
                                 [-f PDBFILE] [--offset OFFSET]
                                 [--format GENERAL_FORMAT]
                                 [--minimum_distance MINIMUM_DISTANCE]
                                 [--multichains MULTICHAINS]

for a helical bundle with four chains the user should initially renumber the chains this will lead to a less troubled road further down. There is a script that the user can use for this:

python ~/pythonscripts/dev/renumber_pdb_starting_from_one/renumber_to_1_pdbfile.py PDBFILE > NEW_PDBFILE

To generate a resfile for matching 

python ../generate_position_file.py -d 1 -f  new.pdb --multichains 1 -d 7 --format 1

d: distance 7 AA ( this might have to be changed depending on the radius you are sampling )
--format ( format for matching other option would be per cst ) 
--mulitchains ( assumes you have the chains A,B,C,D must be different from 0 )

this will generate an outfile, position.chains.
